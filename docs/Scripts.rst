DFHack Scripts
##############

Lua or ruby scripts placed in the ``hack/scripts/`` directory are considered for
execution as if they were native DFHack commands. They are listed at the end
of the ``ls`` command output.

Note: scripts in subdirectories of hack/scripts/ can still be called, but will
only be listed by ls if called as ``ls -a``. This is intended as a way to hide
scripts that are obscure, developer-oriented, or should be used as keybindings
or from the init file.  See the page for each type for details.

``kill-lua`` stops any currently-running Lua scripts. By default, scripts can
only be interrupted every 256 instructions. Use ``kill-lua force`` to interrupt
the next instruction.

The following pages document all the standard DFHack scripts.
